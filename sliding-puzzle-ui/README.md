# Sliding Tile Puzzle Solver

UI for my sliding tile puzzle solver. First provide an input to solve. 4x4 puzzles can take several minutes, 5x5 puzzles are currently unsolvable using my algorithm. Once it's been solved, the user can see the steps needed to produce the result.

## How to run

`npm run dev` to run the application.
`npm run test` to run the tests.
